	- [X] plan store actions
		- [X] sketch actions for post
		- [X] sketch actions for comment
		- [X] sketch actions for category
	- [X] write util to fetch and update API data
		- [X] save in ./src/utils

		- [X] build delete funcs on top - TEST CURR ARROW
		- [X] build out async actions to leverage each function
	- [X] DRY up async action creators
	- [X] set up middleware for async actions
	- [X] test ability to store and access data
		- [X] App component: dispatch actions with correct payload
		- [X] actions: fill out actions to make API calls
		- [X] actions: fill out actions to format and pass along payload
		- [X] log: check the store state after reducer resolves
		- [X] actions: update and fix issues as you test
		- [X] reducers: update and fix issues as you test
	- [X] fill out reducers to account for all actions
	- [X] mimic store shape in API: posts.js {'postId':{postObject},} pairs instead of arrays
	- [X] plan [selectors](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) to build on state
- [ ] plan out UI
	- [X] inventory of view components
	- [ ] relations between components
	- [ ] state that will live in each component
- [ ] what are the events that should CRUD data, e.g. adding post, updating score
	- [ ] include displaying sorted by: category, timestamp, title, author, voteScore
- [ ] decide on a directory structure
	- [ ] by category vs by feature
	- [ ] consider number of components, their complexity and their dependencies
- [ ] update README to reflect decisions from the planning stage

## Core Tasks
- [X] install and save Redux
- [X] create a Redux store in index.js
- [ ] update the Redux store to match the sketch above
	- [ ] check and test against what's in the API
	- [ ] implement actions
	- [ ] implement reducers
- [ ] default state and initial state
	- [ ] configure initial state for each reducer
	- [ ] configure default state for createStore
- [ ] check that Redux dataflow works correctly
	- [ ] each of the events that should CRUD data from Planning above
	- [ ] include displaying posts sorted by 
- [ ] build out basic components for each of the four views in README.md Specifications
	- [ ] Root view
	- [ ] Category view
	- [ ] Post Detail view
	- [ ] Create/Edit view
- [ ] build out basic components for post and comment UI
	- [ ] Post UI
	- [ ] Comment UI
- [ ] wire up views to display data correctly
	- [ ] use component state to handle form input fields and controlled components
	- [ ] otherwise use your reducers to control the rest of your data
	- [ ] mapPropsToState and mapDispatchToState
- [ ] break subcomponents into smaller pieces
	- [ ] comments with controls as displayed in Post Detail view
	- [ ] post as displayed in Root view, Category view and Post Detail view
- [ ] style the app to be "presentable and easy to navigate"

## Testing
- [X] install React devtools
- [X] install Redux devtools
	- [ ] include extension in index.js createStore
	- [ ] compose to use Thunk or async middleware enhancer
- [X] Set up your IDE including syntax highlighting [for JS and JSX](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel)
- [ ] Consider [React test utilities](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html)
- [ ] Plan to write [Redux tests](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/WritingTests.html)
- [ ] Test your selectors, actions, reducers [together](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1171)
	- [ ] the [ducks approach](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect#motivation-for-memoized-selectors)
- [ ] Hot loading and time traveling

## Issues
- [ ] Editing a nonexistent post or comment adds an error object as post or comment to the store slice
- [ ] How much state to load into store as user navigates app?

## Beyond MVP
- [ ] custom favicon
- [ ] implement distinct user objects/models for logging in and permissions
- [ ] ability to manage categories
	- [ ] currently obtained from posts
	- [ ] currently "added" when a post submits a new category string
	- [ ] currently "deleted" when none have it
	- [ ] currently "updated" when all posts with a category string change that string
- [ ] add sorting for comments as well within Post Detail view
- [ ] consider [immutability](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html)
- [ ] test and optimize for growth in data, cases where iterating over huge numbers of posts and comments
	- [ ] how well does the shape of your store account for big data fetching, mapping, filtering, reducing?
	- [ ] how to increase performance?
- [ ] edited comments display notice that they've been edited
	- [ ] keep original timestamp
	- [ ] label and timestamp the edit (requires backend changes - wait until graded)
- [ ] search posts and comments
	- [ ] search all comments on all posts vs current API fetching comments for one post
