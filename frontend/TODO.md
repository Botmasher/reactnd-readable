	- [X] each of the events that should CRUD data from Planning above
	- [X] include displaying posts sorted by timestamp, voteScore (at a minimum)
- [X] build out basic components for each of the four views in README.md Specifications
	- [X] Root view
	- [X] Category view
	- [X] Post Detail view
	- [X] Create/Edit view
- [X] Comments UI
	- [X] list comments
	- [X] handle create
	- [X] handle update
	- [X] handle delete
- [X] Prop types
- [X] Routing between components
	- [X] withRouter around app connect so router links fire when clicked
	- [X] decisions about handling [url params](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/UsageWithReactRouter.html#containersvisibletodolistjs) and passing [link state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41466055/how-do-i-pass-state-through-react-router) (category, post id)
	- [X] get post, comment, category id through URL
- [X] build out supporting components for post and comment UI
	- [X] Post UI
	- [X] Comment UI
- [X] wire up views to display data correctly
	- [X] use component state to handle form input fields and controlled components for posts
	- [X] use component state to handle form input fields and controlled components for comments
	- [X] otherwise use your reducers to control the rest of your data
	- [X] mapPropsToState and mapDispatchToState
- [X] break components into smaller pieces
	- [X] identify needed [container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) and [split](https://gist.github.com/chantastic/fc9e3853464dffdb1e3c) from presentation components
	- [X] break out sort menu and posts listing
	- [X] comments with controls as displayed in Post Detail view
	- [X] post as displayed in Root view, Category view and Post Detail view
- [X] style the app to be "presentable and easy to navigate"
- [X] switch catch 404 routes
- [X] update README to reflect changes during core task implementation

## Testing
- [X] install React devtools
- [X] install Redux devtools
	- [X] include extension in index.js createStore
	- [X] compose to use Thunk async middleware enhancer
- [X] Set up your IDE including syntax highlighting [for JS and JSX](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel)
- [ ] Consider [React test utilities](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html)
- [ ] Plan to write [Redux tests](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/WritingTests.html)
- [ ] Test your selectors, actions, reducers [together](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1171)
	- [ ] the [ducks approach](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect#motivation-for-memoized-selectors)
- [ ] Hot loading and time traveling

## Beyond MVP
- [X] custom favicon
- [ ] truncate categories list beyond certain width in mobile view
- [ ] pagination for posts and comments lists
- [ ] localization including dates
- [ ] implement distinct user objects/models for logging in and permissions
- [ ] ways of building and organizing UI
	- [ ] Grommet or other for component UI
	- [ ] go all the way to [build a component library](https://hackernoon.com/building-a-react-component-library-part-1-d8a1e248fe6c)
	- [ ] Dynamically change out links with [FilterLink](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/UsageWithReactRouter.html#navigating-with-react-router)
- [ ] make better use of categories
	- [ ] categories ui (category list and links) and container to browse, sort, manage categories
	- [ ] currently "added" when a post submits a new category string
	- [ ] currently "deleted" when none have it
	- [ ] currently "updated" when all posts with a category string change that string
- [ ] store route strings separately
- [ ] add sorting for comments as well within Post Detail view
- [ ] consider [immutability](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html)
- [ ] test and optimize for growth in data, cases where iterating over huge numbers of posts and comments
	- [ ] how well does the shape of your store account for big data fetching, mapping, filtering, reducing?
	- [ ] how to increase performance?
	- [ ] sorting and other calculations done on large API responses handled through backend endpoint
- [ ] edited comments display notice that they've been edited
	- [ ] keep original timestamp
	- [ ] label and timestamp the edit (requires backend changes - wait until graded)
- [ ] search posts and comments
	- [ ] search all comments on all posts vs current API fetching comments for one post
